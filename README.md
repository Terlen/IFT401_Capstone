SocialSec is a Google Chrome browser extension that helps reduce poor password habits.

SocialSec utilizes the Facebook GraphAPI to build a personalized collection of a user's interests and relationships found on their public Facebook page. SocialSec then monitors the user's web activity for account creation activity. If the user attempts to use a name, term, or other information found on their Facebook page, SocialSec alerts the user that such information is publically available and may compromise the security of their password.
