				<h2>What is SocialSec?</h2>
				<p>SocialSec is a Chrome extension that uses your public social information to help you improve your security.</p>
				<h2>Why do I need SocialSec?</h2>
				<p>If you use social media frequently, you may not be aware of how much of your personal information is actually available to the world. 
				This information can be used agianst you in a Social Engineering attack; a type of hacking. 
				SocialSec helps to protect you from these attacks by alerting you whenever a password you create contains some of this public information</p>				
				<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
				<p>After SociaSec is installed, all you need to do is login.
				Once that is completed, your interaction with Social Sec is complete until it detects a possible security concern.
				If that happens, SocialSec will send you a notification which will take you to a page where you can address the problem.</p>	
				<h2>What is a Social Enginneering attack?</h2>
				<p>We're all human and part of that is not having a perfect memory. 
				Since we need passwords, we tend to create ones that are easier to remember by including names or dates that are familiar.
				Social Enginnering attacks take advantage of this practice by using known information to make educated guesses about your password rather than just trying everything at once.
				Social media has made this task much easier for those types of attacks as a great deal of public information is potentially availble for anyone to see.
				</p>					
				<h2>Why is my word list so small?</h2>
				<p>As SocialSec is still in its infancy, as of right now only permanent public infomation is available to us.
				In future releases, your wordlist will potentially contain ALL of your public information giving much more control over your security.</p>	
				<h2>Why is there such a large date range?</h2>
				<p>SocialSec uses a large set of dates, even ones that were before your birth year, since these dates can still be a part of your public soical media.
				For example, you may use your mother's birthyear for a password and then post about going to her 43rd birthday.
